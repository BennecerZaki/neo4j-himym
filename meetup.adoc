= Neo4j London Meetup, 2nd June 2015:  The How I met your mother graph

In this session we'll be working with a graph of How I met your mother scrapped from the link:http://how-i-met-your-mother.wikia.com/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother_Wiki[HIMYM wiki].

We're going to write some queries to explore the dataset and learn Neo4jâ€™s cypher language while doing so.
If we have time we can even look at how to merge some other data sets in as well.

== Setup

First things first, let's get Neo4j running on your machines.

* Download Neo4j from http://www.neo4j.com/download
* Windows users: Install desktop application & then click the 'start' button
* Mac/Linux: Unpack archive & then `./bin/neo4j start`
* Browse to http://localhost:7474. You should see the following:

And we're ready to go!

== The Episodes

The first thing we need to do is load the episodes into Neo4j.
I've already done the scrapping of the data into a CSV file which is hosted on github.

We'll start by exploring that using Cypher `LOAD CSV` command.
The `LOAD CSV` command allows us to process CSV files hosted on a web server or our local file system.

The syntax looks like this:

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV [WITH HEADERS] FROM "http or file URI" AS row
[FIELDTERMINATOR ","]
[MATCH MERGE RETURN WITH]
----

Let's give it a try:

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mneedham/neo4j-himym/master/data/import/episodes_full.csv" AS row
RETURN row
LIMIT 1
----

If you run that query you should see the following output:

[table]

We can see that an episode has lots of different attributes - a title, date aired, season, ranking etc.

Now let's create an episode node for each row of the CSV file. We'll do this by combining the `LOAD CSV` command with the `MERGE` command.

=== What's `MERGE` got to do with it?

The `MERGE` command does a `MATCH` or `CREATE` i.e. if the node already exists then we'll return it and if it doesn't then we'll create it.

It's quite useful in this context as we may want to run our import script multiple times but don't want to end up with duplicate episodes.

The syntax of `MERGE` is as follows:

[source, cypher]
----
MERGE (:Label1:Label2 {id: "primaryKeyValue"})
---

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mneedham/neo4j-himym/master/data/import/episodes_full.csv" AS row
MERGE (episode:Episode {id: TOINT(row.NumberOverall)})
ON CREATE SET episode.title = row.Title,
              episode.viewers = toFloat(row.Viewers),
              episode.dateAired = row.DateAired,
              episode.timestamp = TOINT(row.Timestamp),
              episode.number = TOINT(row.NumberInSeason),
              episode.season = TOINT(row.Season),
              episode.ranking = TOINT(row.Rating)
----

If everything has run properly you should now have 208 nodes in your database.
Let's write a query to check that:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (:Episode)
RETURN COUNT(*) AS numberOfEpisodes
----

=== Finding specific episodes

By now you should have all the episodes loaded so let's try and find some individual episodes.
We'll start by finding an episode by it's `id` which in this case is its overall position in the series:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (episode:Episode)
WHERE episode.id = 5
RETURN episode
----

or we can use a bit of syntactic sugar:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (episode:Episode {id: 5})
RETURN episode
----

[table]

==== Exercises

* Find an episode by title rather than by id
* Only return the `title` and `dateAired` properties rather than all the properties
* Which episode had the highest viewership?

=== What's the query doing under the covers?

We have two ways of exploring what Neo4j is doing when we execute a query.

Prefixing a query with `EXPLAIN` will return the query plan based on statistics the database has. It won't run the query.

Prefixing a query with `PROFILE` will run the query and return the actual query plan that was executed.

Give those a try with the queries we just ran. What do you notice?

=== Index all the things

Let's add an index on a few properties of an episode so that we can find them more quickly in future without having to scan through all the episodes

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX ON :Episode(id)
----

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX ON :Episode(title)
----

Now let's import some more data to make it more of a graph and less of a key/value store.

=== Seasons

If you explored the episodes data carefully you'll remember that we actually stored a `season` property on the episode nodes.

This is fine if we only intend to use the season as meta data but if we want to write queries that start with a season it would be better off represented as a node.

We can refactor the graph to introduce season as a first class citizen with the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (episode:Episode)
MERGE (season:Season {number: episode.season})
MERGE (episode)-[:IN_SEASON]->(season)
----

This query has three steps:

* Look up all the episodes
* Create `season` nodes using the `MERGE` command so we don't get duplicates
* Create a relationship from the episode to its season

==== Exercises

* How many episodes were there in each season?

=== References

The wiki also contains information about the references that episodes make to each other.

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mneedham/neo4j-himym/master/data/import/references.csv" AS row
RETURN row
LIMIT 1
----

We'll load this data in 3 steps:

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mneedham/neo4j-himym/master/data/import/references.csv" AS row
MERGE (:Reference {text: row.ReferenceText})
----

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mneedham/neo4j-himym/master/data/import/references.csv" AS row
MATCH (reference:Reference {text: row.ReferenceText})
MATCH (referenced:Episode {id: TOINT(row.ReferencedEpisodeId)})
MERGE (referenced)<-[:HAPPENED_IN]-(reference)
----

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mneedham/neo4j-himym/master/data/import/references.csv" AS row
MATCH (reference:Reference {text: row.ReferenceText})
MATCH (referencing:Episode {id: TOINT(row.ReferencingEpisodeId)})
MERGE (referencing)-[:REFERENCES]->(reference)
----

* Which episode is referenced most often?
* For episode 'z' which ones should I have seen to understand all the references made?

-> Connecting the episodes together
-> What sort of queries can we do with a linked list of episodes?

== Topics graph

I ran the transcript for each of the episodes through Prismatic's Topic Graph and stored the results into a CSV file. We can add this to the graph as well:

[source, cypher]
----

----

Can we do some sort of episode similarity here?
Jaccard similarity?


== Building the query for an episode's page

* Episode title
* Characters
* Writers

Multi query vs All in one

WITH & COLLECT
