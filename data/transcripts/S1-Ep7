						<strong><em>YEAR 2030</em></strong><br /><br /><strong><em>LIVING ROOM</em></strong><br /><br />(Daughter and Son sitting on couch)<br /><br />Future Ted: Kids, before I met your mother, when I was still out there searching, I learned something valuable, that love is not a science.<br /><br />Daughter: Wow, that was a great story, Dad.<br /><br />Son: We're gonna go watch TV.<br /><br />(Daughter and Son get up and leave)<br /><br />Future Ted: You see, sometimes in life, you just have to accept that certain things can't be explained. And that's kinda scary.<br /><br />(Daughter and Son return to sit on couch)<br /><br /><strong><em>BAR</em></strong><br /><br />(year 2005; Ted, Barney and Robin sitting around table; Lily and Marshall run in)<br /><br />Marshall: Oh my God.<br /><br />Lily: I know, I'm still shaking.<br /><br />(Lily grabs Barney's drink and drinks from it)<br /><br />Barney: What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold.<br /><br />Robin: Are you guys OK? Marshall (yelling over to bartender): Another round and back it up for me and Lily.<br /><br />Ted: What happened?<br /><br />Marshall: We saw something, up in the apartment.<br /><br />Lily: Something bad.<br /><br />(flashback to Lily and Marshall entering apartment while kissing)<br /><br />Marshall: I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy.<br /><br />Lily: Oh, mucho sexy. You quiero Marshall.<br /><br />(Marshall and Lily hug and kiss, Lily looks over and sees something and looks scared)<br /><br />Lily: Oh my God.<br /><br />(Lily and Marshall scream and run out of the apartment)<br /><br />(cut back to present scene in bar)<br /><br />Ted: What was it?<br /><br />Marshall: Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.<br /><br />Lily: Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse. That was a huge cockroach.<br /><br />Marshall: Baby, it was a mouse. It had a whiskers.<br /><br />Lily: But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae<br /><br />Barney: Marshall ran away from a cockroach.<br /><br />Marshall: It, it was a mouse.<br /><br />Barney: Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.<br /><br />Robin: Ooh, my story's on. Ted, pay attention. Carl, turn it up.<br /><br />(newscast on TV)<br /><br />Robin: I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker. Ellen, your company, Love Solutions boasts a 100% success rate. What's your secret?<br /><br />Ellen: Science. Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love.<br /><br />All I have to do is input the variables, run the algorithm, and presto manifesto, you have a soulmate, and it works. Just ask all of my happy couples. And these are just the attractive ones, I have more photos in the bathroom.<br /><br />Robin: Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky...<br /><br /><strong><em>BAR</em></strong><br /><br />Barney: Was that chick at the end really a client?<br /><br />Robin: Yes.<br /><br />Barney: We're signing up.<br /><br />Ted: What?<br /><br />Barney: Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.<br /><br />Ted: I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat.<br /><br />Marshall: No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur and only mammals have fur.<br /><br />Lily: It was a cockroach.<br /><br />Marshall: Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach was if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just killed.<br /><br />Lily: Oh my God.<br /><br />(Lily grabs Barney's drink as he's about to take a drink from it and drinks it herself)<br /><br />Barney: Come on.<br /><br /><strong><em>APARTMENT</em></strong><br /><br />(Ted sitting on couch reading magazine, Ted hears squeaking and tiny footstep noises, Barney barges into the apartment_<br /><br />Barney: Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking.<br /><br />Ted: What?<br /><br />Barney: My boat is sinking.<br /><br />Ted: You have a boat?<br /><br />Yes, I bought a boat last year at a police auction. I just got a call from a guy down at the marina that it's leaning starboard at a 45 degree angle. If I don't get there right now, it's gonna capsize. Now, come on!<br /><br />(Ted and Barney run out of the apartment)<br /><br /><strong><em>OFFICE</em></strong><br /><br />(Ted and Barney are filling out applications for Love Solutions)<br /><br />Ted: Your boat is sinking. That was good.<br /><br />Barney: Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again. (chuckles)<br /><br />(Ellen enters the office)<br /><br />Ellen: All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step.<br /><br />Barney: Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless s*x.<br /><br />Ellen: You deserve more.<br /><br />Barney: That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we.<br /><br />Hey, is there anyway I can let it be known that I love cuddling?<br /><br />(Ellen, Ted and Barney sit around desk)<br /><br />Ellen: Oh, of course you can. That is so...<br /><br />Barney: It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?<br /><br />Ellen: Get out.<br /><br />Barney: What?<br /><br />Ellen: I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again.<br /><br />Barney: Oh my God, people do that.<br /><br />Ellen: You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?<br /><br />Barney: What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?<br /><br />Ellen: That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.<br /><br />(Barney looks like he doesn't believe her, Ellen stands up quickly, Barney stands up to run away)<br /><br />Barney: OK, Ted, let's go.<br /><br />(Ted gets up to leave)<br /><br />Ellen: Not you, you stay.<br /><br />(Ted and Ellen sit back down)<br /><br />Ellen: You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package.<br /><br />Barney (through office door): It's pronounced 'Pa-kojj.'<br /><br />Ellen: Get outta here!<br /><br />(Barney runs away)<br /><br />Ellen: You I can work with. You give me three days and I will find the woman you will marry.<br /><br />Ted: Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea.<br /><br />Ellen: Plenty of fish in the sea. Yes, there's 9 million people in New York, 4.5 million women. Of course you wanna meet someone roughly your own age, let's say, plus minus 5 years. So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000. But, uh, wait<br /><br />48% of those are already in relationships and then you have to eliminate half for intelligence, sense of humor and compatibility and then you have to take out the ex-girlfriends and the relatives and oh, we can't forget those lesbians and then that leaves us with 8 women.<br /><br />Ted: That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?<br /><br />Ellen: There are 8 fish in that big, blue ocean, Ted. And if you feel confident that you can reel one into your boat without me, there's the door.<br /><br />Ted: Do you take credit cards?<br /><br /><strong><em>BAR</em></strong><br /><br />(Barney and Robin sitting at booth; Marshall and Lily walk in)<br /><br />Lily: OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.<br /><br />(Lily sits by Barney and takes his drink away from him and drinks it)<br /><br />Barney: Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.<br /><br />Marshall: It's bigger now. It's been feeding.<br /><br />Lily: We were just upstairs watching TV.<br /><br />(flashback to Lily and Marshall sitting in apartment on couch in front of TV)<br /><br />Marshall: Ah gosh.<br /><br />(Marshall and Lily see something on ground)<br /><br />Lily: OK, let's do this.<br /><br />(Lily grabs aerosol spray can, Marshall grabs large phone book, Lily sprays and Marshall throws phone book on it, Lily screams and Marshall holds her)<br /><br />Marshall: Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.<br /><br />(phone book starts moving towards kitchen, Marshall and Lily run out of apartment)<br /><br />(back to scene at bar)<br /><br />Barney: So did you get a good look at it?<br /><br />Lily: Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach...<br /><br />Marshall: But it has mouse-like characteristics. Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.<br /><br />Robin: So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?<br /><br />Lily: It's a cockamouse.<br /><br />Robin: What?<br /><br />Lily: It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...<br /><br />Barney: Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?<br /><br />Robin: That's impossible. That simply can't happen.<br /><br />Lily: Oh, but it can.<br /><br />Marshall: And it has<br /><br />Lily: And it's pissed.<br /><br />(Lily and Marshall down shots)<br /><br />(Ted walks into the bar)<br /><br />Ted: Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open.<br /><br />Marshall: There was no time.<br /><br />Robin: So Love Solutions, did you meet the love of your life?<br /><br />Ted: She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried?<br /><br />Lily: Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.<br /><br />Ted: Did you just use my name as a verb?<br /><br />Barney: Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when<br /><br />Ted: OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days.<br /><br /><strong><em>LOVE SOLUTIONS OFFICE</em></strong><br /><br />(subtitled '20 minutes later,' Ted enters Ellen's office)<br /><br />Ted: Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.<br /><br />Ellen: Ted, hi. I meant to call you. The computer is still crunching the numbers. Busy as a bee, that little computer.<br /><br />Ted: You said it was gonna be three days.<br /><br />Ellen: Did I?<br /><br />Ted: Hm.<br /><br />Ellen: Three days? Really?<br /><br />Ted: Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so...<br /><br />Ellen: How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK.<br /><br />(return from commercial break)<br /><br />Ted: There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8.<br /><br />Ellen: I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.<br /><br />Ted: But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect.<br /><br />Ellen: How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate. It's my hook. I could probably find somebody for you if you were gay.<br /><br />Ted: Well, I'm not.<br /><br />Ellen: A little bi maybe?<br /><br />Ted: No. You're messing with me, right?<br /><br />Ellen: Come see for yourself.<br /><br />(Ellen brings Ted over to her computer)<br /><br />Ellen: I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher, and look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6...<br /><br />Ted: There's a 9.6 right there.<br /><br />(Ted points to something on computer monitor)<br /><br />Ellen: Don't touch the computer. Yes, Sarah O'Brien. I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.<br /><br />Ted: What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?<br /><br />Ellen: 8.5.<br /><br />Ted: So he sucks.<br /><br />Ellen: No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.<br /><br />Ted: Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?<br /><br />Ellen: Yes, 9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up. Ted, look, I have a lunch. Please. I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day.<br /><br />(Ted and Ellen leave office, Ted sneaks back into office and goes to computer and takes printouts, hides them in his jacket and runs back out of office)<br /><br /><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content">

The cockamouse.<br /><br />Marshall: And it's the size of a potato.<br /><br />(Marshall shows everyone his drawing of the cockamous)<br /><br />Robin: So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse?<br /><br />Marshall: Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse.<br /><br />(Barney and Ted are sitting at booth with Ted looking at printouts he took from Love Solutions)<br /><br />Ted: My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.<br /><br />She wants to have two children. Her guilty pleasure song is Summer Breeze by Seals and Croft.<br /><br />Barney: Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.<br /><br />Marshall: And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic.<br /><br />Lily: Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.<br /><br />Marshall: For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know.<br /><br />Robin: Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.<br /><br />Marshall: So you really don't believe in the cockamouse?<br /><br />Robin: Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster.<br /><br />Marshall: If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.<br /><br />(Robin walks over to Ted and Barney)<br /><br />Marshall: It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese...<br /><br />Ted: OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.<br /><br />Barney: You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.<br /><br />Ted: All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?<br /><br />Future Ted VO: That's right, I did the math.<br /><br /><strong><em>DOCTOR'S OFFICE</em></strong><br /><br />(Ted waiting in examination room, doctor walks in)<br /><br />Ted: Hi.<br /><br />Sarah: Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien.<br /><br />Ted: I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too.<br /><br />(Sarah laughs)<br /><br />Ted: Hi, I'm Ted.<br /><br />Sarah: So, what are we doing today?<br /><br />Ted: I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy.<br /><br />Sarah: I'm exactly the same.<br /><br />Ted (singing): Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.<br /><br />Sarah (joining in singing): Blowing through the jasmine in my mind.<br /><br />Ted: Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song.<br /><br />Ted: Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch.<br /><br />Sarah: I love brunch.<br /><br />Ted: It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.<br /><br />Sarah: I like the way you think, Architect Mosby.<br /><br />Ted: Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?<br /><br />Sarah: Oh, that's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday.<br /><br />Ted: Friday night?<br /><br />(return from commercial break)<br /><br />Ted: Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations.<br /><br />Sarah: Thank you.<br /><br />Ted: I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here?<br /><br />Sarah: Only a little.<br /><br />Ted: Well, by some million to one shot, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call.<br /><br />Sarah: OK, but it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress.<br /><br />Ted: I'm sure you do.<br /><br /><strong><em>APARTMENT</em></strong><br /><br />(Lily and Marshall working on contraption in living room area, Robin walks in from kitchen)<br /><br />Robin: Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it?<br /><br />Lily: OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe.<br /><br />Marshall: Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot.<br /><br />Robin: Bad maps. Creaky houses. Hillbilly in a gorilla suit.<br /><br />Marshall: Aliens.<br /><br />(Robin shakes her head)<br /><br />Marshall: Oh, come one, you gotta give me aliens. Stonehenge. Area 51. There's alien crap all over the place.<br /><br />Robin: You can't be serious.<br /><br />Marshall: My friend, you just poked the bear.<br /><br />(Marshall walks toward his bedroom, Ted and Barney walk in through front door)<br /><br />Ted: So, my 9.6, beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.<br /><br />Robin: Oh.<br /><br />Lily: Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.<br /><br />Ted: Yeah, it was a long shot. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know...<br /><br />Lily: Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.<br /><br />(Ted and Barney both raise their hands)<br /><br />Barney: Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game.<br /><br />(Marshall walks in from his bedroom reading from a book)<br /><br />Marshall: On the night of July 2nd, 1947, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico.<br /><br />Robin: Oh geez.<br /><br />Marshall: Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you. Dr. O'Brien.<br /><br />Ted: What?<br /><br />Marshall: When suddenly, an array of<br /><br />(Ted jumps over to machine and shushes Marshall to listen to message)<br /><br />Sarah (on answering machine): Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien. About today, listen, I really need to talk to you. Call me, I'll be at the office all day.<br /><br />Barney: The doctor will see you now.<br /><br />(return from commercial break)<br /><br />Ted: What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?<br /><br />Lily: Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.<br /><br />Ted: Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.<br /><br />In that scenario, I'm not interfering, I'm a happy ending.<br /><br />Barney: (chuckles) Happy ending.<br /><br />Ted: Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot.<br /><br />(Ted leaves apartment)<br /><br />Barney: All right, see you later. Happy hunting.<br /><br />(Barney and Robin get up to leave)<br /><br />Lily: Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.<br /><br />Barney: Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles.<br /><br />(pot falls down from contraption)<br /><br />Marshall: Oh my God!<br /><br />Lily: Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it?<br /><br />Marshall: Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive.<br /><br />Lily: Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?<br /><br /><strong><em>DOCTOR'S OFFICE</em></strong><br /><br />(Ted enters Dr. O'Brien's office)<br /><br />Ted: Hello again.<br /><br />Sarah: I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.<br /><br />Ted: Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything.<br /><br />Sarah: You have a basal cell carcinoma.<br /><br />Ted: Anything else?<br /><br />Sarah: Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it.<br /><br />Ted: Wait, then you're still getting married.<br /><br />Sarah: Of course I'm still getting married.<br /><br />Ted: But we're a 9.6.<br /><br />Sarah: Excuse me.<br /><br />Ted: OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5.<br /><br />Sarah: You looked at my file.<br /><br />Ted: I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fiancé thinks we're a better match.<br /><br />Sarah: I am getting married on Saturday.<br /><br />Ted (singing): Summer breeze...<br /><br />Sarah: Ted.<br /><br />Ted: Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?<br /><br />Sarah: Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?<br /><br />Ted: See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.<br /><br />Sarah: Ted, just calm down.<br /><br />Ted: Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.<br /><br />Sarah: Ted, Ted, do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you just because some computer says so.<br /><br />Ted: Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused.<br /><br />Sarah: Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, 8.5 equals a perfect 10.<br /><br />Ted: You're right.<br /><br /><strong><em>LAB</em></strong><br /><br />(Marshall bring Sudeep cockamouse in pot)<br /><br />Sudeep: If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career.<br /><br />Marshall: Brace yourself, dude. This is gonna blow your mind hold.<br /><br />(Sudeep moves cover to peek into pot)<br /><br />Sudeep: You b*st*rd, I actually got excited about this.<br /><br />Marshall: What?<br /><br />Sudeep: It's empty.<br /><br />(Sudeep removes cover of pot completely and Marshall looks in)<br /><br />Marshall: Wait, but if it's not here, that means...Lily.<br /><br /><strong><em>APARTMENT</em></strong><br /><br />(Robin sits on couch, Lily walks into living room area but backs away and hides)<br /><br />Lily: Robin.<br /><br />Robin: What?<br /><br />(Robin walks over to Lily and sees what she sees)<br /><br />Robin: Oh my God. It's real.<br /><br />Lily: Oh, is it? Do something.<br /><br />(Robin throws drink at it)<br /><br />Lily: What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?<br /><br />Robin: It was the only think I could think of.<br /><br />(Marshall runs into apartment)<br /><br />Marshall: Lily thank God.<br /><br />(Lily points over to cockamouse)<br /><br />Marshall: Lily, I love you.<br /><br />(Marshall grabs cockamouse and run towards window)<br /><br />Marshall: Robin, open the window!<br /><br />(Lily, Marshall and Robin run over to window and Robin tries to open window, Marshall throws cockamouse out the window)<br /><br />Robin: It can fly.<br /><br />Lily, Marshall: Wow.<br /><br />Marshall: Be free, mutant beast. I'll miss this private war of ours. I grew to admire your tenacious...Oh my God, it's headed this way.<br /><br />(Marshall slams window shut and animal flies into it)<br /><br /><strong><em>LOVE SOLUTIONS OFFICE</em></strong><br /><br />(Ellen sits alone in the dark, Ted enters office)<br /><br />Ted: Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back.<br /><br />Ellen: I'm a failure. I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted. I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program. Last night, I stood out on the street for five hours showing your photo to random pedestrians, no takers. Although this transvestite hooker said he/she would do you for half price because you kinda look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything.<br /><br />Ted: Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit cliché?<br /><br />Ellen: It's for the bourbon.<br /><br />Ted: This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me.<br /><br />Ellen: No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.<br /><br />Ted: I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking.<br /><br />Ellen: No, you're never gonna find anybody. And every year, you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder.<br /><br />Ted: You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days.<br /><br />Ellen: No you won't.<br /><br />Ted: Yes I will<br /><br />Ellen: How do you know? Ted: I don't know, but I believe. Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then, dammit, so can I.<br /><br />Ellen: You're losing me.<br /><br />Ted: Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.<br /><br />Ellen: So I should keep looking?<br /><br />Ted: Of course you should. And now you're gonna do it for free.<br /><br /><strong>END</strong>
