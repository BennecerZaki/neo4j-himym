Please stop!<br /><br />Well, I was just gonna slow down for pictures, but that level of enthusiasm can't go unrewarded.<br /><br />♪ How I Met Your Mother 9x01 ♪<br /><br />The Locket<br /><br />Original Air Date on September 23, 2013<br /><br />(phone chimes)<br /><br />Hmm.<br /><br />Oh, look at my little cousins in their flower girl dresses.<br /><br />Aw, they'll look so cute next to the ring bear.<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />Wait, you said ring <em>bear-er,</em> right?<br /><br />Ring bear.<br /><br />Ring <em>bear-er.</em><br /><br />Ring bear.<br /><br />Are you planning some crazy stunt with a dangerous wild animal at our wedding?<br /><br />(phone chirps)<br /><br />Because...<br /><br />Oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.<br /><br />Oh, boy.<br /><br />My brother wants to know what time he &quot;goes on&quot; at the reception.<br /><br />What does that mean?<br /><br />Every wedding he attends, James insists on... performing.<br /><br />♪ Islands in the stream<br /><br />♪ That is what we are<br /><br />♪ No one in between...<br /><br />So?

I have a baby!<br /><br />Please, I-I have to get to New York.<br /><br />Yeah, well, you should have thought about that before you attacked me.<br /><br />All right, boys, you got this?<br /><br />Good.<br /><br />Let's get this bird in the air. Ah, you're both banned from this flight.<br /><br />So I was driving with my friend, who thinks he',[/i] sThe Road Trip Master.&quot;<br /><br />He has leather driving gloves.<br /><br />Who wears those?<br /><br />Huge dorks, that's who.<br /><br />NARRATOR: <em>Your mother was lying.<br /><br />She had her own pair.</em><br /><br />And he always makes us stop to see some weird roadside attraction no one except him gives a crap about.<br /><br />Nerd alert.<br /><br />NARRATOR: <em>Kids, you remember the seven-hour detour on our road trip to Disney World so your mother didn't miss that goat in South Carolina who could blow smoke rings.</em><br /><br />And he won't go one mile an hour over the speed limit.<br /><br />That would drive me crazy.<br /><br />I would give him a humiliating nickname until he stopped driving like a little girl.<br /><br />NARRATOR: It was &quot;Lady Tedwina Slowsby.&quot;<br /><br /><em>And it worked.</em><br /><br />Okay, look, if it's true, if we are...<br /><br />(gags softly)<br /><br />You know.<br /><br />It's really not that big a deal.<br /><br />Okay, we-we know we won't have kids.<br /><br />And even if we did, King Joffrey's parents were brother and sister, and he was a fair and wise leader.<br /><br />Yeah. Look, no one ever needs to know but us.<br /><br />Exactly.<br /><br />(both chuckle)<br /><br />I know.<br /><br />BARNEY: <em>We might have to...</em><br /><br />ROBIN: <em>Take care of Ranjit.<br /><br />Hey, you just finished my...<br /><br />Creepy telepathic murder thought.<br /><br />Oh, it must be a soul mate thing.<br /><br />Unless... it's a weird cousin thing.</em><br /><br />(gags softly)<br /><br />So we'll be good either way, right?<br /><br />Honey?<br /><br />That's right... sweetie.<br /><br />Now, get over here, you.<br /><br />Gah, just try and stop me.<br /><br />Aw. Ooh, ooh.<br /><br />Ooh, mmm, mmm, mmm.<br /><br />Well, I can't wait till tonight.<br /><br />I have got some naughty-naughty-naughty things planned.<br /><br />Aw.<br /><br />Oh, wow, you have certainly piqued my incest.<br /><br />Interest. Interest!<br /><br />I still can't believe he dragged me to the childhood home of some stupid bucklesmith no one's ever even heard of.<br /><br />Yeah, who cares about Florian van Otterloop?<br /><br />I never told you his name.<br /><br />Sumbitch?<br /><br />I mean, why'd he have to act that way?<br /><br />He knows I hate how he gets on road trips.<br /><br />It almost seems like he wanted you to storm off.<br /><br />But we're going to the same place.<br /><br />There's no reason why he'd want to ditch me.<br /><br />NARRATOR: <em>And suddenly Lily remembered that a week ago, I'd helped Robin look for her long-lost locket.<br /><br />But it was gone.<br /><br />Then Lily told me the locket actually got stashed in my pencil box, but when I opened it... the locket wasn't there.</em><br /><br />Good.<br /><br />'Cause that locket's trouble.<br /><br />How? It's-it's just a friendly, innocent wedding gift.<br /><br />It's not innocent.<br /><br />Ted, you think if you can get that locket for Robin you'll win her back.<br /><br />Lily, I've let it go.<br /><br />I mean... What?<br /><br />There's, like, a one percent chance that Stella has the locket from when we lived together.<br /><br />Promise me you didn't call the woman who left you at the altar so that you could find that locket.<br /><br />Of course not.<br /><br />I e-mailed her.<br /><br />Ted.<br /><br />But Stella's living in L.A. now.<br /><br />And even if she has it, it's buried in some storage unit.<br /><br />She said I'd have to fly out there and look for it myself.<br /><br />Promise me you aren't about to do that.<br /><br />I promise.<br /><br />Sumbitch!<br /><br />You better hope when Sweaty finally gets off that phone, he can get me on the next flight to New York.<br /><br />I got the password from my mom.<br /><br />I'm gonna take that photo down myself.<br /><br />You know, I don't give a damn about your photo.<br /><br />My daughter is giving a big speech for the Model U.N. at her school, and I'm gonna miss it because of you.<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br />Her father and I are separated.<br /><br />She lives with her dad.<br /><br />And if I don't make it... she's never gonna trust me again.<br /><br />I'm so sorry.<br /><br />Wow, that worked on you?<br /><br />Let's hope Pit Stains is as dumb as you are.<br /><br />What? Why is this so hard for my mom?<br /><br />All you do is you click the photo, and then you click on the...<br /><br />I don't see...

What do you want?<br /><br />You want a car? You got a car. Beat it.<br /><br />What kind of car do you want?<br /><br />Too slow, you get a minivan.<br /><br />Next. Ah, midsize sedan.<br /><br />Incoming. Next.<br /><br />Yes! You want a gas option?<br /><br />Nobody wants a gas option. Get out of here.<br /><br />Next.<br /><br />Hello. I need a car.<br /><br />You've got it. That's all of them.<br /><br />We're all out of cars, everybody.<br /><br />Wait, no!<br /><br />You let this guy beat you?<br /><br />Ma'am, it's not a race.<br /><br />That right there is why you lost.<br /><br />Maybe this is your fault.<br /><br />Did you ever think of that?<br /><br />Maybe if you had just been a little bit nicer, then you would be the one driving this lovely...<br /><br />What kind of car is it?<br /><br />NARRATOR: <em>Now, kids, I don't remember the actual name of this car, but to an environmentalist like Marshall, this car was a monstrosity.</em><br /><br />2006 Monstrosity.<br /><br />♪ Monstrosity<br /><br />♪ 'Cause global warming's not real. ♪<br /><br />Oh, no, not a Monstrosity.<br /><br />I'll take it.

Give me the keys, old man!<br /><br />It's just so freaking huge!<br /><br />Well, actually it's a Monstrosity Sport, so it's a little smaller.<br /><br />♪ Monstrosity Sport<br /><br />♪ It's still freaking huge.<br /><br />Fine. I'll take it.<br /><br />But I'm also gonna need a baby seat.<br /><br />We're all out of baby seats. Get out of here.<br /><br />Oh, my God... what am I gonna do?<br /><br />I don't care.<br /><br />(groans)<br /><br />Can I make a suggestion?<br /><br />I rent the car, then I go buy the car seat, come back here, pick you guys up, and then the three of us drive to New York together.<br /><br />(laughs quietly)<br /><br />Let me get this straight.<br /><br />So, you're gonna rent the car, go and get a baby seat for my son, and then drive all the way back here to pick me up.<br /><br />That's right.<br /><br />Well, then you're gonna need some cash. Here.<br /><br />Hundred bucks ought to cover it.<br /><br />So, we'll see you soon.<br /><br />You got it, Michael! Marshall.<br /><br />Doesn't matter now, does it?<br /><br />Remember this day, Marvin.<br /><br />Not only is this the day that we either saw Prince or a... a really flamboyantly dressed greyhound, it's also the day that your dad chose not to be a jerk... and put his trust in humanity.<br /><br />Just watch where it gets us.<br /><br />Shucksy-doodles!<br /><br />NARRATOR: <em>Uncle Marshall was just about ready to abandon his faith in humanity.</em><br /><br />But let's back up a little bit.<br /><br />And now the true tale of the Stinson Curse.<br /><br />BARNEY: <em>Moscow, 1807.</em><br /><br />(Russian accent): What a wonderful night at the opera.<br /><br />Wouldn't you agree, Comrade Barnovski?<br /><br />(Russian accent): I would indeed, Comrade Jamesokoff.<br /><br />But you know what made it truly wonderful?<br /><br />Being here with my wife... the beet in my borscht, the fur on my hat, the only person I've ever been attracted to, ever.<br /><br />I feel the same way about Kyle... my plutonic friend from work.<br /><br />(clattering)<br /><br />Is it just me, or did that feel like we hit an old Gypsy woman?<br /><br />Yep. Old Gypsy woman.<br /><br />Good call, Barnovski. Oh, well, she's just a peasant.<br /><br />Home, Smirnoff.<br /><br />Wait, she's saying somethink!<br /><br />(low, deep moan)<br /><br />Hornier.<br /><br />Hornier.<br /><br />Hornier?<br /><br />Sonobovich!<br /><br />Did she just put a curse on us?<br /><br />Eh, nonsense, brother.<br /><br />Okay, let's go, Smirnoff.<br /><br />Smirnoff?<br /><br />Homina, hominovich. Mmm, Smirnoff, I would climb you like the Kremlin Wall.<br /><br />What's happening to me?<br /><br />Don't you see? You're getting hornier, brother, just like the old Gypsy woman said!<br /><br />Oh, hello there.<br /><br />(chuckles) Ever had a White Russian?<br /><br />BARNEY: <em>For the next 200 years, every male member of the Stinson family was afflicted by the Gypsy's curse, an unquenchable thirst for booty</em> that no committed relationship<br /><br /><em>could ever satisfy.</em><br /><br />That is, until my brother James met his husband Tom.<br /><br />The day they got married, they lifted the curse forever, freeing me from the shackles of having s*x with lots of different women.<br /><br />Although, sometimes Robin and I still use the shackles.<br /><br />Bondage five!<br /><br />Whoa. I can't, I can't, I can't.<br /><br />(phone rings)<br /><br />Go for Barney!<br /><br />Ah.<br /><br />Thank you, Linus.<br /><br />This is worse than I thought.<br /><br />I know. Showtime, no HBO?<br /><br />JAMES: No.<br /><br />Tom and I are getting divorced.<br /><br />What? TED: What?<br /><br />That's why you look extra handsome.<br /><br />I do get extra hot when I'm single.<br /><br />Your skin looks amazing.<br /><br />Looks amazing. I know.<br /><br />So... so what happened? Why-why'd you guys break up?<br /><br />Well, the thing to remember is that when something like this happens, it's nobody's fault.<br /><br />You cheated on him. Repeatedly.<br /><br />I thought about keeping it quiet, but then I realized, wouldn't my family want me to be honest with them about news this big?<br /><br />Oh, can I just say five things?<br /><br />What is the matter with... sorry, six-- you?!<br /><br />Ooh! What?!<br /><br />I'm-I'm sorry about you and Tom, but you can't just drop a bombshell like this so close to someone's wedding.<br /><br />You broke the curse. You and Tom are the only couple that makes Barney believe in marriage.<br /><br />(chuckles) Really? The only couple?<br /><br />I mean, no one else comes to mind?<br /><br />Been together 17 years?<br /><br />She's a spunky redhead, he's got calves that launched a thousand lady boners?<br /><br />BARNEY: Hey, sorry about that.<br /><br />Hey, did you guys know that Sunday is James' and Tom's anniversary?<br /><br />How cool is that?<br /><br />We're anniversary bros!<br /><br />Every year, we should go out and celebrate... just the two of us.<br /><br />Listen, bro, you...<br /><br />I know, I know, &quot;Please, Barney, you don't have to get us an anniversary gift this year.&quot;<br /><br />You get them an anniversary gift?<br /><br />Why shouldn't I? They're the one couple that makes me believe marriage is possible.<br /><br />I mean, I'm sitting right here.<br /><br />Thank you, Linus.<br /><br />JAMES: Barney, the thing is...<br /><br />Cover your ears and hum &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />It's for the bride.<br /><br />Oh, it's for... (humming)<br /><br />Okay, listen, James, my cousin Vince is a Mountie.<br /><br />His girlfriend is back home, but he gets gay at weddings.<br /><br />He's yours. I am giving you Vince.<br /><br />Just please, don't tell Barney.<br /><br />If he finds out that the only successful marriage in his life is over...<br /><br />I hate everyone at this table.<br /><br />...it'll spook him.<br /><br />I don't want him getting spooked.<br /><br />Robin, have some faith.<br /><br />Do you really think what you and Barney have is that fragile?<br /><br />I don't want to find out.<br /><br />Fine.<br /><br />Thanks, baby.<br /><br />No sweat. Mmm...<br /><br />So, James, seriously, where's Tom?<br /><br />He can't make the wedding.<br /><br />He had his wisdom teeth out.<br /><br />Ugh! On top of a divorce?<br /><br />That is rough.<br /><br />Uh-oh.<br /><br />What is she talking about?<br /><br />Tom and I are getting a divorce.<br /><br />Excuse me.<br /><br />Vince... off the table.<br /><br />What was that? I don't know.<br /><br />It just came out.<br /><br />That's it. It's barely even noon.<br /><br />You're cut off.<br /><br />Thank you, Linus.<br /><br />Thank you, Linus.<br /><br />Thank you, Linus.<br /><br />Thank you, Linus.<br /><br />Thank you, Linus.<br /><br />Okay, but after that one, you're cut off!<br /><br />No! No, you are not doing this. Step away from the desk.<br /><br />What are you talking about?<br /><br />You just found out about James and Tom, and it totally freaked you out, and now you're asking this guy to point you in the direction of the nearest, dirtiest strip club.<br /><br />Oh, well, that-that's a tough one.<br /><br />Uh, the nearest one that's-that's kind of dirty is The Sand Box, but the, uh... the dirtiest one that's nearby is The Crab Shed.<br /><br />Dude.<br /><br />Sorry. Uh, but hey, if-if you do go, maybe you could take Ted.<br /><br />I'm really worried about that kid.<br /><br />No, Robin, I am not going to a strip club.<br /><br />Especially right now.<br /><br />Could you imagine the day shift at The Crab Shed?<br /><br />Robin...<br /><br />I came to the desk to get this.<br /><br />Is that the key to our room?<br /><br />It's the key to James's room.<br /><br />Oh, my.<br /><br />What is that?<br /><br />It's an erotic cake.<br /><br />I wanted to surprise them for their anniversary.<br /><br />Is that... is that James and Tom?<br /><br />Mmm, caramel marzipan, chocolate marzipan.<br /><br />I love chocolate marzipan.<br /><br />So does Tom. Used to anyway.<br /><br />This is, uh, absolutely the, uh... the weirdest thing anyone has ever done for their sibling.<br /><br />I love you so much.<br /><br />You thought I was gonna freak out.<br /><br />Well, I mean, a Gypsy cursed your family to become hornier and do awesome guitar solos.<br /><br />Can you blame me?<br /><br />Look, am I bummed about James and Tom getting a divorce?<br /><br />Obviously. But I don't need them to make me believe in true love anymore.<br /><br />I've got you for that now.<br /><br />Mmm.<br /><br />Oh, man, now I gotta figure out what to do with all this stuff.<br /><br />Well, before we do that... um, would it be all right if I nibbled on your brother's Ding Dong?<br /><br />How about we nibble on my brother's Ding Dong together?<br /><br />I'd like that.<br /><br />NARRATOR: So, they cleaned all that stuff<br /><br /><em>out of there and had a talk with James.<br /><br />And Barney didn't freak out,</em> because here's the thing, kids.<br /><br /><em>When you believe in people, people come through.</em><br /><br />Just so we're clear, I pick the music.<br /><br />Of course.<br /><br />Say it.<br /><br />Say, &quot;Daphne picks the music.&quot;<br /><br />Daphne picks the music.<br /><br />And you pay for gas.<br /><br />Are you kidding? Do you have any idea how much gas this thing takes?<br /><br />(engine revs)<br /><br />No, no, okay!<br /><br />Okay, I pay for gas.<br /><br />Good. Now, get in.<br /><br />It's a long ride to Phoenix.<br /><br />Say what?<br /><br />(laughs)<br /><br />I'm just kidding.<br /><br />Oh, this is gonna be fun.<br /><br />This must be the singles table.<br /><br />(chuckles)<br /><br />Guess it is.<br /><br />Well, it's kind of nice to be asking this question instead of answering it for a change: How are you doing?<br /><br />I don't know.<br /><br />I'm trying to be happy for my brother, but, uh... I guess a person has a different perspective on weddings when he knows what's down there at the end of the aisle.<br /><br />It's not all champagne and frosting.<br /><br />Mr. Stinson, your room is ready.<br /><br />And, Ted... she's right around the corner.<br /><br />Thank you, Curtis.<br /><br />I feel it, too.<br /><br />No, no, no, the-the housekeeper.<br /><br />She's in the room that's right around the corner from yours.<br /><br />Oh. So another hour, tops.<br /><br />Sure.<br /><br />Okay, see you later, Ted.<br /><br />You're not giving up, James.<br /><br />And neither am I.<br /><br />(footsteps approach)<br /><br />TED: Hey, beautiful.<br /><br />Hi.<br /><br />God, you look great.<br /><br />What? Come on.<br /><br />You do!<br /><br />I've been in a car all morning.<br /><br />I just ate a croissant crumb that I found in my bra.<br /><br />I'm disgusting.<br /><br />Yeah, I saw you do that. And it was super hot. Come here.<br /><br />(chuckles) You come here. Come here.<br /><br />No, you come here. Come here.<br /><br />Hey, you want to hear something funny?<br /><br />Mm-hmm.<br /><br />One year ago today, almost to the minute, I was sitting at this very table right in that seat.<br /><br />Oh, yeah. I can see it.<br /><br />Nursing your gin and tonic with three extra limes, doing the crossword, probably being all showboat-y about it.<br /><br />I wasn't being showboat-y about it.<br /><br />&quot;Vesuvius&quot;&quot; Boo-yah!<br /><br />Oh, wait, that doesn't fit.<br /><br />The point is, one year ago today, I made a promise to myself right at this table.<br /><br />THE MOTHER: What was the promise?<br /><br />BOTH TEDS: I'm coming back, and I'm bringing you.<br /><br />Wait a second. Hold it.<br /><br />One year ago today, you hadn't even met me.<br /><br />I know, but I knew I would.<br /><br />And now it's a year later.<br /><br />And here I am.<br /><br />Here you are.<br /><br />Love in your eyes, baked goods in your undergarments.<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />You picked a real winner, Mosby.<br /><br />I did.<br /><br />Okay, seriously, what the crap is taking so long with these rooms?<br /><br />It was like this last year.<br /><br />I'll be right back.<br /><br />I'll be right here.<br /><br />Sorry that took so long.<br /><br />Please... try to enjoy your stay.<br /><br />I will.<br /><br />Try to.<br /><br />I will enjoy my stay.<br /><br />Try.<br /><br />Not gonna try.<br /><br />Just... just gonna do it.<br /><br />Good for you.<br /><br />Not good for me.<br /><br />No, just-just neutral for me.<br /><br />Attaboy. No, at not a boy.<br /><br />It gets better.<br /><br />I am fine, Curtis. Okay?<br /><br />I enjoy and appreciate the happiness of other people whether I am in a relationship or not. Okay? Curtis?<br /><br />So just-just... just go ahead and give me my one key because I am fine.<br /><br />Oh, come on! I need another drink.
