						Can I get you guys anything to drink?<br /><br /><strong>Both</strong>: Scotch, neat.<br /><br />Jinx.<br /><br />(gasps)<br /><br />Oh, my... God.<br /><br /><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Kids, you may be wondering why five adults in their 30s would take a jinx so seriously. It all started one day five years ago.</em><br /><br />Ooh, <em>Van Helsing.</em><br /><br />Ooh, <em>Van Helsing.</em><br /><br />Jinx. You're jinxed.<br /><br />That means that you can't speak until someone who was present for the jinx says your name, or else you will have very bad luck.<br /><br />(scoffs)<br /><br />That's ridiculous.<br /><br />(both gasp)<br /><br />You broke the jinx.<br /><br />Marshall, I'm a grown-ass man.<br /><br />I'm on my building's co-op board.<br /><br />When I say a Pinot Noir tastes luxuriously earthy with a hint of rhubarb, I'm not faking it.<br /><br />I've had several of the same sexual partners as Henry Kissinger.<br /><br />I'm not about to stop talking just because I was jinxed.<br /><br /><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Barney broke three limbs and two vertebrae, but he never broke another jinx.<br /><br />In fact, he started taking jinxes way too seriously.</em><br /><br />Barney, I'm on hold with Sports Talk AM to talk to my childhood hero from the Minnesota Twins.<br /><br />Who's your childhood hero?<br /><br />Frank Viola. Frank Viola--<br /><br />jinx!<br /><br />(over phone): Hello, this is Frank.<br /><br />Anyone there?<br /><br />Hello?<br /><br />I can hear you breathing, you coward.<br /><br /><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>So, when someone finally jinxed Barney for the first time in years, we were pretty psyched.</em><br /><br />The reign of terror is over!<br /><br />I've had this cigar in my pocket for two years, waiting for this moment.<br /><br />Aw, that would've been good about two years ago.<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />(all whooping)<br /><br />Huzzah! Huzzah.<br /><br /><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh, oh, oh, you want us to say your name and un-jinx you?<br /><br />I don't think so, pal.<br /><br />This is gonna be a long jinx.<br /><br />Like Yom Kippur services long.<br /><br />The only difference is, Yom Kippur's a fast and this one's gonna be a slow.<br /><br />Oh! ROBIN: Now, Ted, I was wondering if you could expand upon what you were saying earlier about antiquated currency.<br /><br />Ah, yes, yes.<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, the buffalo nickel was modeled on the Black Diamond bison rather than the more iconic Western Plains bison.<br /><br />To wit, if President Taft had had his way, we'd all be talking about the egret nickel.<br /><br />♪ How I Met Your Mother 8x11-12 ♪<br /><br />The Final Page, Part One and Two<br /><br />Original Air Date on December 17, 2012<br /><br /><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>In the winter of 2012 the skyscraper that I designed was about to open, which got me thinking about the most influential architecture professor I ever had.</em><br /><br />So when the children of our grandchildren's children ask us &quot;Who were we,&quot; they'll find the answer carved into the granite poetry of our architecture.<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />It doesn't get any better than that.<br /><br />Class dismissed.<br /><br />Wow, just wow.<br /><br />Do you need something?<br /><br />I have an apple I was hoping to eat in silence.<br /><br />Of course, Professor Vinick, I, um, I-I sketched out a design, and it'd be such an honor if you took a look at it.<br /><br />Oh, well.<br /><br />It is believed that it took the pharaohs over 100 years to build the Sphinx.<br /><br />So... you think...<br /><br />I should spend more time on it?<br /><br />Oh, dear God, no.<br /><br />This is terrible.<br /><br />Then, why'd you mention the Sphinx?<br /><br />(laughs)<br /><br />I find my mind is often with the Sphinx.<br /><br />Anyway, you'll never be an architect.<br /><br /><em>You'll never be an architect.<br /><br />You'll never be an architect.</em><br /><br />(laughing): <em>You'll never be an architect!</em><br /><br />Well, guess what.<br /><br />I sent Professor Vinick the invitation to the opening of my building, so he'll see that I did become an architect, and that I've moved past his petty, hurtful words.<br /><br /><strong>Robin</strong>: Wow.<br /><br />15 years later and you're still this obsessed.<br /><br />Yeah, if Vinick ever goes missing, the cops are gonna come looking for him in your basement.<br /><br />Totally, he's Ted's pit guy.<br /><br />How dare you?<br /><br />And what is that?<br /><br />A pit guy is someone you've been obsessed with for so long...<br /><br /><em>that it's driven you crazy enough to throw them in a pit in your basement like in</em> The Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />(screaming)<br /><br />(laughing)<br /><br />I'm not gonna <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> him.<br /><br />At most, I'd <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em> him.<br /><br />Though I don't see a scenario where he agrees to play me in a pentathlon.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm with Ted-- there is no one I hate enough to throw into a pit.<br /><br />What?<br /><br /><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>When Robin's most hated coworker Patrice started dating Barney, she became obsessed.</em><br /><br />Patrice, Patrice goes in your pit.<br /><br />Guys, I told you, I am done obsessing about Patrice.<br /><br />Just drop her.<br /><br />Drop her in a pit.<br /><br />Enough.<br /><br />We all have people that we would throw in our pits, and I'm sure we all have people who would like to throw us in their pits.<br /><br />Yeah, if Marshall or I ever go missing, I'll tell you whose basement to look in.<br /><br />Daryl LaCourte.<br /><br />Oh, no.<br /><br />It's creepy Daryl.<br /><br />Let's get out of here before he sees us.<br /><br />Hey, hot sack coming through.<br /><br />Ha... ha...<br /><br />Hi, Daryl. Hey, Daryl. Hey!<br /><br />I feel like I never see you guys anymore.<br /><br />Like whenever I'm getting to a party, you're just leaving.<br /><br />Even that party at your place-- you guys just raced off into the night at 7:30.<br /><br />That's weird.<br /><br />But this is great-- the three hackmigos back together again.<br /><br />We played Hacky Sack together once freshman year, Daryl.<br /><br />Once.<br /><br />November 14, 1996.<br /><br />That is the best memory ever.<br /><br />Sure.<br /><br />(grunts)<br /><br />The three hackmigos for life.<br /><br />To this day, we are still getting e-mails and posts from Daryl.<br /><br />He has commented on every photo of Baby Marvin we have ever posted, and then he comments on his own comments.<br /><br />(door opens)<br /><br />(all clamoring excitedly)<br /><br />Hey, guys, look, it's Bar... none, my favorite non-speaking jinxed person in the world.<br /><br />How was your day?<br /><br />Yeah, I didn't get a word of that.<br /><br />Sorry, buddy.<br /><br />Ah, Scherbatsky, it's my favorite time of year.<br /><br />Didn't know you liked Christmas so much.<br /><br />No, year-end reviews.<br /><br />We get to fire some people.<br /><br />Get into the spirit.<br /><br />Look, Sandy, you might enjoy firing people for petty personal differences.<br /><br />I'd hardly call giving me gonorrhea a petty personal difference.<br /><br />But I am a professional, and I would never fire someone for unprofessional reasons.<br /><br />Well, somebody's got to go.<br /><br /><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Kids, the thing about pit people, sometimes you don't even know you have one until you have a chance to push 'em in.</em><br /><br />Hi, Robin.<br /><br />Not happening, bro.<br /><br />Not happening, bro.<br /><br />Hand get tired?<br /><br />Not happening, bro.<br /><br />I hold in my hand the RSVP from Professor Vinick.<br /><br />Uh-huh.<br /><br />Ah, he's checked &quot;Will not attend,&quot; which is fine, because all I needed to know was that he knows.<br /><br />So now I will throw this in the trash and never look at it.<br /><br />What's this? &quot;I believe you've sent this to the wrong person.<br /><br />I have no idea who Ted Mosby is.&quot;<br /><br />Uh-oh. Uh-oh.<br /><br />Oh, you'll remember who I am, Professor Vinick.<br /><br />You'll never forget it.<br /><br />Not happening, bro.<br /><br />Ted, just because we're coming with you to Wesleyan does not mean that we condone your behavior.<br /><br />Just using it as an excuse to see the old campus... and maybe watch you have a complete mental breakdown.<br /><br />What are you even gonna do when you see Professor Vinick?<br /><br />Oh, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.<br /><br />Sweet merciful Franks Gehry and Lloyd Wright, from what brilliant mind was this work of art sired?<br /><br />Mosby.<br /><br />Ted Mosby.<br /><br />(coughing): Architect.<br /><br />But that's-that's...<br /><br />Impossible?<br /><br />Looks like you were wrong, Vinick.<br /><br />Dead wrong.<br /><br />(distorted): No!<br /><br />(yells)<br /><br />(laughs)<br /><br />Be careful, Ted.<br /><br />Revenge fantasies never work out the way you want.<br /><br />Especially dance-<br /><br />based revenge.<br /><br />My prom was rough, guys.<br /><br /><strong>Lily</strong>: Ooh!<br /><br />We're almost there.<br /><br />Oh, I can't wait to see the old campus.<br /><br />I'm gonna grab one of those giant dining hall hot dogs.<br /><br />Oh, I love those huge wieners.<br /><br />I'm not so sure you heard me.<br /><br />I said, &quot;I love those huge wieners.&quot;<br /><br />I love them.<br /><br />In my mouth.<br /><br />So, let me ask you a few questions, Clarice... Patrice.<br /><br />How would you rate your performance in the last six months?<br /><br />Well, I don't like to talk about myself, but all my coworkers deserve an A-double-plus, that's for suresies.<br /><br />Ooh, fancy lotion.<br /><br />It puts the lotion in the basket.<br /><br />It's just, this is really nice lotion.<br /><br />And what a pretty basket, Robin.<br /><br />I know, that's why I bought it, Patrice!<br /><br />Man, it's like nothing has changed. Mmm, I know.<br /><br />The bun, the relish.<br /><br />That's a knee.<br /><br />It's a beautifully drawn knee, so?<br /><br />That's a barn.<br /><br />Oh, knee barn, right.<br /><br />That's a great idea, Lily.<br /><br />On the way home, we should stop at the knee barn, pick us up some wholesale knees. Yeah.<br /><br /><strong>Man</strong>: Marshall? Lily!<br /><br />You... you're here.<br /><br />Hi, Daryl.<br /><br />(quietly): Hi, Daryl.<br /><br />Hi.<br /><br />Wow, after all these years.<br /><br />You look just like you do in my paintings.<br /><br />Come here, guys.<br /><br />(grunts)<br /><br />There are men and there are gods.<br /><br />Antoni Gaudí was both.<br /><br /><strong>Ted</strong>: <em>There are jerk faces and there are buttholes.<br /><br />Professor Vinick was both.<br /><br />Good one, Ted.<br /><br />Come on, Vinick, give me an opening.</em><br /><br />Gaudí's architecture gave expression to the anarchic geometric form of nature.<br /><br />TED (mocking): <em>&quot;Gaudí's architecture...&quot;<br /><br />Actually, that's a really good point.</em><br /><br />♪ Wow, Professor Vinick<br /><br />♪ Man, you taught me so much<br /><br />♪ About architecture and life<br /><br />♪ God, your lectures are so cool ♪<br />♪ I'll earn your respect and we'll be best friends. ♪<br /><br />Okay, it doesn't get any better than that.<br /><br />(sniffles)<br /><br />No, it doesn't.<br /><br />What are you doing here, Daryl?<br /><br />Well, I live right down the street.<br /><br />But I work right here.<br /><br />Whoa. Oh, boy.<br /><br /><strong>Marshall</strong>: Are those...<br /><br />(clears throat) ...our, our faces up there, buddy?<br /><br />Hack, yeah!<br /><br />It was just as much your idea as mine to open up a Hacky Sack store here at Wesleyan.<br /><br />So you never left?<br /><br />Once. I met a girl on Craigslist, and I flew to Boston to meet her.<br /><br />She was a man, 300 pounds, and robbed me.<br /><br />Still, the best night of my life.<br /><br />Until now!<br /><br />The three hackmigos back together again!<br /><br />You know, I've been waiting forever to give you something.<br /><br />You're coming with me to my house, and I'm not taking no for an answer.<br /><br /><strong>Barney</strong>: <em>Dude, this is your chance.<br /><br />Set me free, and I will lie you out of this creepynightmare.</em><br /><br /><strong>Marshall</strong>: <em>This is a tough one.<br /><br />On the one hand, we might die.<br /><br />On the other, you're jinxed.</em><br /><br /><strong>Barney</strong>: <em>Let me free, Marshall.<br /><br />This guy could be violent.</em><br /><br /><strong>Marshall</strong>: <em>Violent... Viola...<br /><br />Frank Viola.</em><br /><br />We would love to come to your house, Daryl!<br /><br />Yeah!<br /><br />Okay, um... how often are you and Barney doing it?<br /><br />That's a strange question, Robin.<br /><br />You're right.<br /><br />Maybe I should leave.<br /><br />Yeah, maybe you should.<br /><br />You're fired.<br /><br />Wow. Just wow.<br /><br />Ted Mosby. I'm a former student of yours.<br /><br />You know, I actually became an architect.<br /><br />Any chance you remember me?<br /><br />Oh, please excuse me, I've been teaching for over 20 years.<br /><br />All the faces start to blend together unless you have a, a weird mustache or, or something.<br /><br />Junior year I tried to grow muttonchops, but people kept saying my face made them nauseous.<br /><br />Well, not people. You.<br /><br />Anay, I would be honored if you, if you took a look at my building.<br /><br />This... is hideous.<br /><br />You'll never be an architect.<br /><br />(echoing): <em>You'll never be an architect.<br /><br />You'll never be an architect. You'll</em> never <em>be an architect!<br /><br />You'll never be an architect.</em><br /><br />Wait. I was mistaken.<br /><br />You most definitely will be an architect.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />These are astonishing, Handlebar Pete.<br /><br />So, when you said &quot;surprise in your house,&quot; what you really meant was &quot;surprise in the poorly lit windowless basement of your house.&quot;<br /><br />Oh, you guys are gonna love what I have to show you.<br /><br />I am so excited, I could just cry and laugh and scream and just punch the wall over and over and over and over and over!<br /><br />Could we just see it, like, up in the living room or anywhere less... gimp-storagey?<br /><br />(laughs)<br /><br />I just realized I want to take a picture of this.<br /><br />I want to put your faces on my mantel like a trophy.<br /><br />Like a trophy!<br /><br />Aah...! Aah...!<br /><br />(singsongy): Here I come.<br /><br />And I've got your surprise right here!<br /><br />No! We don't want your surprise, Daryl!<br /><br />We're not your amigos, we're definitely not your hackmigos.<br /><br />And before you murder us, you should know that we have a child!<br /><br />He probably has eight or nine!<br /><br />What? Murder?<br /><br />I wanted to give you a check.<br /><br />For $100,000... for coming up with the idea of the Three Hackmigos with me.<br /><br />I brought you down here to show you all my inventory.<br /><br />Business has really exploded.<br /><br />(laughs)<br /><br />I mean, I'm sort of the Mark Zuckerberg of jam-band concert parking lot athletics.<br /><br />Well, second.<br /><br />But I'm coming for you, Devil Stick Ron.<br /><br />(screaming)<br /><br />Why would you fire me?<br /><br />Because nobody should be as happy as you are.<br /><br />And also your cookies... they're only pretty good.<br /><br />(gasps)<br /><br />Robin, is this really about me?<br /><br />(voice breaking): No, it's not.<br /><br />The old &quot;fire and bang.&quot; Respect, Scherbatsky.<br /><br />Pretty good, right? Right, Handlebar Pete?<br /><br />Ah, you got it easy with that sweet, sweet 'stache.<br /><br />Hey, Ted, I see you're holding a little version of your building and yelling at strangers.<br /><br />So I assume it all worked out?<br /><br />I realized, since I work in a three-dimensional medium, the only way to really stick it to Vinick would be with a three-dimensional model.<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't march in there thinking, &quot;I'm gonna do the worm.<br /><br />That'll show 'em!&quot;<br /><br />Seriously, guys, I can't stress enough how bad my prom was.<br /><br />Speaking of the past...<br /><br />Wow, we feel like idiots. We're sorry.<br /><br />You know, honestly, it's fine.<br /><br />Look how great I'm doing.<br /><br />Look at what I've built. I don't need the validation of some people from college to feel good about myself.<br /><br />My life is amazing!<br /><br />I own a timeshare in St. Barts with P-Funk!<br /><br />The, the whole band?<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />Do you guys jam?<br /><br />That's <em>all</em> we do.<br /><br />(all gasp)<br /><br />So, you completely rejected the guy who's been obsessing about you for 16 years, and he was okay with it?<br /><br />Whoa.<br /><br />Is creepy Daryl more emotionally adjusted than I am?<br /><br /><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Kids, sometimes in life you'll make a pit for someone in your mind.<br /><br />But ultimately the only person in that pit is yourself.</em><br /><br />I'm sorry.<br /><br />Just seeing you with Barney has brought up some old feelings, and I...<br /><br />I really don't like feelings.<br /><br />But that's not your fault or Barney's fault.<br /><br />It's just really hard seeing you with him.<br /><br />♪ There's been a book on the side of the bed... ♪<br /><br /><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Which means there's only one person who can let you out of the pit.</em><br /><br />♪ Many years from now<br /><br />♪ I know you'll hear me somehow... ♪<br /><br />So you fired Patrice?<br /><br />No, she's staying.<br /><br />♪ The places we will go...<br /><br />Let's get out of here, guys.<br /><br />Oh, Mr. Mosby.<br /><br />You built a model of your building.<br /><br />No.<br /><br />Why? To prove some sort of point?<br /><br />This is just sad.<br /><br />No, no, I was just throwing it out.<br /><br />Sure, you were.<br /><br />No!<br /><br />No, I-I-I had a transcendent moment where I found emotional clarity!<br /><br />And I realize shouting that makes it seem like it's not true, but I did!<br /><br />Yeah, we're gonna grab some snacks.<br /><br />You guys want anything?<br /><br />Spicy beef jerky.<br /><br />Got you loud and clear.<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br />Oh, my God! Barney!<br /><br />You unjinxed me!<br /><br />I'm free! If the bison on the nickel could hear you talk about them, they would diminish their population even further on purpose.<br /><br />If Lily wants a big wiener in her mouth, she's got my number.<br /><br />And I'm sorry that you took the rap for all the farting on the car ride up here. That was me! (sighs)<br /><br />The ring! What's, what's, what's the ring?<br /><br />Right, the ring. I'm gonna ask Patrice to marry me.<br /><br /><strong>Both</strong>: Are you serious?<br /><br />Jinx! Good!<br /><br />I need to say some things without you interrupting.<br /><br />Yes, I am serious. I know that if you could talk, you'd say that I'm crazy or that I'm overcorrecting or that I'm moving too fast.<br /><br />But you would be wrong.<br /><br />Look, I have banged my way through every bimbo in the tristate area, and it left me feeling nothing but, but broken.<br /><br />But now, with Patrice, for the first time in my life, I feel settled and happy.<br /><br />I want to feel this way forever.<br /><br />So tomorrow night on the roof of the World Wide News building--<br /><br />that's Patrice's favorite spot--<br /><br />I'm gonna ask her to marry me.<br /><br />Ah, poot-tu-tat! You're jinxed.<br /><br />I'll unjinx you if you'll follow these two rules: one: you can't try to talk me out of it, and two: you can't tell anybody. Agreed?<br /><br />It's a jinx swear, so if you break it, I get to hit you in the nuts three times with a Wiffle ball bat.<br /><br />Thank you... Ted.<br /><br />Hey...<br /><br />Hi, guys!<br /><br />No. But you're jinxed!<br /><br />I tricked Ted into saying my name.<br /><br /><strong>All</strong>: Aw, come on, Ted!<br /><br />Jinx! Jinx! Ha-ha!<br /><br />The reign of terror is back! (evil laugh)<br /><br />Hey, if you guys don't want me to smoke or fart in here, just speak up.<br /><br />Nothing? Great.<br /><br />Thanks for the spicy beef jerky, dude.<br /><br />Anyway, I think we could all use a little quiet.<br /><br />Unless you have something you want to talk about, Ted?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />(engine starts)<br /><br />Not happening, bro.<br /><br /><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content">

The youngest architect ever to build a skyscraper in New York City!<br /><br />The shockingly still single Ted Mosby.<br /><br />You hear that, ladies?<br /><br />I can't believe the GNB Tower opens tonight.<br /><br />Ted, your building finally gets unveiled to the whole world.<br /><br />(gasps)<br /><br />You hear that, ladies?!<br /><br />Nervous?<br /><br />Everything comes out of my body in liquid form now.<br /><br />Ignore that, ladies.<br /><br />Plus, I, I keep having this nightmare where King Kong shows up to the opening but refuses to climb my building because, in his words, &quot;It's a bit derivative.&quot;<br /><br />Oh, stop it, tonight is gonna be amazing.<br /><br />And we are definitely gonna be there to toast you, but we might have to leave a little early if that's okay.<br /><br />My dad just gave us the most amazing Christmas gift ever.<br /><br />Our first night away since Marvin was born.<br /><br />24 hours straight without that little b*st*rd.<br /><br /><strong>Robin</strong>: Aw.<br /><br />This will be a nice memory to share with Marvin when he's older and deciding whether or not to put you in a home.<br /><br />Hey, we need this.<br /><br />We're maximizing our time away by planning everything down to the minute.<br /><br />See?<br /><br />2:12 p.m.-- guilt Ted into saying it's okay if we leave early tonight.<br /><br />It's okay if you leave early tonight.<br /><br />Look, I just appreciate you showing up at all on your big night away.<br /><br />I mean, Barney's not even gonna be there.<br /><br />What?<br /><br />This is the biggest night of your career.<br /><br />Why isn't Barney coming?<br /><br />I don't know-- he said, &quot;Legendary&quot; and &quot;Challenge accepted,&quot; and then he winked. &quot;Wait for it,&quot; you know, all that stuff.<br /><br />That does sound like him.<br /><br />Well, we're your real friends and we wouldn't miss it for the world.<br /><br />That is why we will see you tonight from 7:03 to 7:14.<br /><br />Bye, guys. Good night. Bye.<br /><br />Okay, what's the real reason Barney's not coming?<br /><br /><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Here was my chance to tell Robin about Barney.</em><br /><br />Yeah, actually, Barney didn't say what he was doing tonight.<br /><br />Anyway, uh, you know, I'm not taking anyone to the opening, so you want to be my date?<br /><br />Sure.<br /><br />Okay, Dad, I-I made you a list of Marvin's nightly schedule down to the minute.<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />Uh, &quot;9:06 p.m.-- put on edible underwear.&quot;<br /><br />Wrong list, wrong list.<br /><br />Come on, relax.<br /><br />I know this little guy like the back of my hand.<br /><br />Dear Lord, what is that?<br /><br />Oh, jam, okay.<br /><br />Just jam.<br /><br />Oh, I-I forgot the lullaby.<br /><br />Do you know Marvin's lullaby?<br /><br />We sing it to him every night.<br /><br />♪ Night, night, little Marvin ♪<br />♪ Stars twinkle for you<br /><br />♪ The Dreamland train's a-chuggin' ♪<br />♪ All your dreams will come true ♪<br />♪ And the horsie says, &quot;Good night&quot; ♪<br />♪ And the birdie says, &quot;Good night&quot; ♪<br />♪ And the elephant says, &quot;Good night&quot; ♪<br />♪ And the skeleton playing his own rib cage ♪<br />♪ Says, &quot;Good Night&quot;<br /><br />♪ And the robot says, &quot;Good night&quot; ♪<br /><br />(robot voice): Good night.<br /><br />(knocking on ceiling)<br /><br /><strong>Man</strong>: Enough with the damn music!<br /><br />♪ And Mr. Nesbit says, &quot;Good night&quot; ♪<br />♪ And the whole world says, &quot;Good night&quot; ♪<br /><br />Take it, Mommy.<br /><br />Got it-- load him up with cough syrup, watch <em>Breaking Bad</em> until he conks out.<br /><br />Just kidding.<br /><br />We did it.<br /><br />Yeah, we did.<br /><br />Now that we're out the door, I actually don't feel anxious.<br /><br />(phone rings)<br /><br />Whoa, oh, my God, it's your dad!<br /><br />Oh, something horrible happened-- aah!<br /><br />Oh, it's Ted, relax.<br /><br />Bar, now.<br /><br />What is it?<br /><br />He needs me.<br /><br />But, baby, what about our magical romantic night?<br /><br />In four minutes we're supposed to be doing hand stuff in the cab.<br /><br />I'll be quick--<br /><br />I'm sure it's nothing huge.<br /><br />That's huge.<br /><br />Yeah, that's why Barney's not coming tonight.<br /><br />He's getting engaged.<br /><br />And I knew that I had to tell Robin.<br /><br />But?<br /><br />I may have, uh... asked her to be my date instead.<br /><br />What is wrong with me?<br /><br />Deep down, is there still some crazy part of me that thinks I'm gonna wind up with Robin?<br /><br />Am I that deluded?<br /><br />If so, I need to grow up.<br /><br />Oh, um, by the way, I'm breaking a jinx swear here, so don't tell Barney or he gets to whack me in the nuts three times with a Wiffle ball bat.<br /><br />Sure, pretty standard.<br /><br />Robin deserves the chance to go after Barney one last time if that's what she wants.<br /><br />Thanks, buddy.<br /><br />This helped.<br /><br />I'm gonna go tell her.<br /><br />One quick thing. Yeah.<br /><br />Don't.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Nice.<br /><br />You know, now that I'm here, I don't feel that anxious.<br /><br />(phone rings)<br /><br />It's my dad-- something horrible's happened!<br /><br />My husband, relax.<br /><br />Hey, um, I'm gonna be a little while, baby.<br /><br />It's a long story, but Ted needs my help.<br /><br />Okay, but hurry or I'm gonna start doing number 11 on my own.<br /><br />You can do that by yourself?<br /><br />Pilates, bitch.<br /><br />Okay, why shouldn't I tell Robin?<br /><br />Because deep down some crazy part of you still thinks you're gonna wind up with her, and I agree.<br /><br />Marshall... I'm sorry, I'm Team Tedward.<br /><br />Always have been, always will be.<br /><br />Now, listen.<br /><br />I want my best friend to be happy.<br /><br />And if Robin could mean happiness for you, then, dear God, why help her go after another man?<br /><br />Because she might still be in love with him.<br /><br />To not tell her, to not give her that chance, it's... it's selfish.<br /><br />So be selfish.<br /><br />I can't do that.<br /><br />Tell that to the onion rings we just &quot;split.&quot;<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br />Robin is my friend.<br /><br />She's always been more than that and you know it.<br /><br />Now, as we speak, my wife is in a hotel room cheating on me... with herself.<br /><br />But I'm not leaving here until you promise not to say a word about this to Robin.<br /><br />Now repeat after me. &quot;I...&quot;<br /><br />Well, I can do more at a time than &quot;I.&quot; &quot;I, Ted Mosby, promise to stop &quot;putting everyone else's interests ahead of my own, and for once in my life, do what's best for me.&quot;<br /><br />I...<br /><br />Sorry, what was the rest of that?<br /><br />Hey, Dad, just taking a break from our amazing night to check in.<br /><br />I bet Marvin's pretty devastated that I'm not there, huh?<br /><br />Not at all-- I don't think he even noticed you're gone.<br /><br />It's kind of like Mommy who?<br /><br />(laughs)<br /><br />Oh... oh, good.<br /><br />But I should probably sing him his nighttime lullaby over the phone, just in case.<br /><br />Sang it already-- nailed it.<br /><br />Did you do the horsie?<br /><br />Yep. The birdie?<br /><br />Yep. Elephant?<br /><br />Yep. Moose.<br /><br />No moose, trick question.<br /><br />Robot.<br /><br />(robot voice): Affirmative.<br /><br />Look, I should go.<br /><br />Marvin's asleep in my arms.<br /><br />Mmm, his head smells like love.<br /><br />Bye.<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br /><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>And so, kids, on that cold December night I decided to take your Uncle Marshall's advice and be a little selfish.</em><br /><br />Whoa.<br /><br />Hello... and hubba-hubba.<br /><br />Aw, thanks.<br /><br />But tonight is about my main man Mosby.<br /><br />Really? Why?<br /><br />Oh, Ted, tell Ranjit the huge thing that's happening tonight.<br /><br />Barney's getting engaged.<br /><br />Ranjit out.<br /><br />Bar-Barney's getting engaged?<br /><br />He asked me to keep it a secret, but I thought you deserved to know... in case you wanted to do something about it.<br /><br />Do you?<br /><br /><strong>Ranjit</strong>: Do you, Robin?<br /><br />Ranjit, a little privacy, please?<br /><br />Sorry, not listening.<br /><br />Nice, uneven floor there, Ted.<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br />Lily, are you drunk?<br /><br />What? I... I'm on vacation.<br /><br />I may have cracked open the minibar to celebrate.<br /><br />Who invited the narc?<br /><br />Hey, listen, I know that you miss Marvin, but it's not like we could've brought him to a black tie event anyway.<br /><br />I don't think that they make tuxedo onesies.<br /><br />I mean, at least not ones that are in style.<br /><br />I mean, a bow tie?<br /><br />Is it 1998 already?<br /><br />Yeah, these parents are so lame and-and clingy.<br /><br />Yeah, it's like, cut the cord already, right, guys?<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, that baby's not even cute.<br /><br />Super ugly baby.<br /><br />It's almost physically repulsive.<br /><br />Aw.... Aw...<br /><br />Great, I just started lactating.<br /><br />Me, too.<br /><br />So, what do you want to do?<br /><br />Robin, I do not want to meddle, but this is like the classic love song says...<br /><br />(singing loudly and high-pitched)<br /><br />Ranjit.<br /><br />Ranjit, let's just communicate via text from now on, okay?<br /><br />(singing stops)<br /><br />I appreciate what you're doing.<br /><br />But I'm not chasing after Barney anymore.<br /><br />I-I just got done being crazy about all that.<br /><br />I mean, why would I want to throw myself back in that pit?<br /><br />Because you're in love with him.<br /><br />No, I'm not.<br /><br />I'm happy for him.<br /><br />So, it doesn't bother you that Barney Stinson's gonna propose to another woman on top of the World Wide News building?<br /><br />Wait, why the top of the World Wide News building?<br /><br />I guess it's Patrice's favorite spot in the city.<br /><br />Damn it, Patrice, that's my favorite spot in the city!<br /><br />Whoa.<br /><br />(phone chimes)<br /><br />Ranjit says, &quot;Whoa.&quot;<br /><br />Okay... (sighs)<br /><br />maybe that one detail stings a little bit, but that doesn't mean I'm in love with Barney.<br /><br />(phone chimes)<br /><br />&quot;Sounds like she's in love with Barney.&quot;<br /><br />Okay, is this divider even slightly soundproof?<br /><br />(phone chimes)<br /><br />&quot;Yes.&quot;<br /><br />With a little winky face.<br /><br />Look, I... I hope it goes well for Barney.<br /><br />I really do.<br /><br />But tonight there is no place I would rather be than at your building.<br /><br />Celebrating with you.<br /><br />Are you sure?<br /><br />Ranjit, to Teddy Westside's kick-ass building.<br /><br />I cannot hear you.<br /><br />We will be there in five minutes.<br /><br />This kid does not mean that you're special.<br /><br />It just means that you're horny and you're easy.<br /><br />Now, come on, let me smell his head.<br /><br />Li-Lily, Lily, no, no, no, no, come on.<br /><br />Seriously, Ted, what is up with the floor?<br /><br />Lily. What?<br /><br />Is it harder than we thought to be away from Marvin? Yes.<br /><br />But are we gonna have fun or are we gonna wallow in the corner like idiots?<br /><br />BOTH (crying): ♪ Night, night, little Marvin<br /><br />♪ Stars twinkle for you<br /><br />♪ The Dreamland train's a-chuggin' ♪<br />♪ All your dreams<br /><br />♪ Will come true.<br /><br />Hey.<br /><br />Do you realize that something you thought up in your head now exists as a part of the Manhattan skyline?<br /><br />That's huge.<br /><br />It's just a building.<br /><br />I mean, I'm incredibly young for such an achievement, but it's just a building.<br /><br />I mean, <em>Architecture Vision Weekly</em><br /><br />may have dubbed it &quot;more than just a building,&quot; but it's just a building.<br /><br />So let's not get carried...<br /><br />Okay, you're right, it's huge.<br /><br />It is huge.<br /><br />You're the star of the party, and who knows?<br /><br />Maybe the future Mrs. Ted Mosby is gonna be there.<br /><br />Yeah, maybe she will.<br /><br />Oh.<br /><br />Wait, this isn't your...<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br />This is the World Wide News building.<br /><br />Go get him.<br /><br />I told you, I am done chasing Barney.<br /><br />Now can we please go to your party?<br /><br />Robin, do you want to spend tonight making small talk with a bunch of bankers in a daring yet refined contemporary masterpiece King Kong should feel lucky to climb...<br /><br />...or do you want to follow your heart?<br /><br />Why do you keep insisting that I have feelings for Barney?<br /><br />(phone chimes)<br /><br />Because you do.<br /><br />See, even Ranjit agrees.<br /><br />Oh, he's got to pee.<br /><br />The point is, you're not over Barney.<br /><br />That's why you freaked out about him proposing on the roof of the World Wide News building.<br /><br />I did not freak out.<br /><br />It's just... a teeny, tiny bit annoying that I am the one who showed her that roof in the first place!<br /><br />Damn it, Patrice!<br /><br />Whoa.<br /><br />(phone chimes)<br /><br />&quot;Never mind; I found a soda bottle.&quot;<br /><br />Okay, that's disturbing.<br /><br />What do you want me to do, Ted?<br /><br />Run up to that roof, knock the ring out of Barney's hand, and say, &quot;Sorry to interrupt, but you should be with me&quot;?<br /><br />Is that what you want?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />I don't.<br /><br />I can't keep making an ass of myself.<br /><br />Well, a word in defense of making an ass of yourself, it's underrated.<br /><br />Eight years ago I made an ass of myself chasing after you, and I've made an ass of myself chasing after you a bunch of times since then.<br /><br />But I have no regrets.<br /><br />Because it led me to something that I wouldn't trade for the world.<br /><br />It led to you being my friend.<br /><br />So, as your friend and a leading expert in the field of making an ass of yourself, I say to you from the heart, get the hell out of this car.<br /><br />(exhales)<br /><br />But, Ted, your big night.<br /><br />It's just a building.<br /><br />(door closes)<br /><br /><strong>Barney</strong>: <em>The Robin.<br /><br />Step one: admit to yourself that you still have feelings for this girl.</em><br /><br />I am hopelessly, irretrievably in love with her.<br /><br />More than she knows.<br /><br /><em>Step two: choose the completely wrong moment to make a drunken move after hanging out at a strip club and get shot down on purpose.<br /><br />Step three: agree that you two don't work, locking the door on any future you could have together.</em><br /><br />I'm done trying to get you.<br /><br />I can't do it anymore.<br /><br /><em>Which will drive Robin nuts.</em><br /><br />Huh.<br /><br /><em>Step four: Robin goes nuts.<br /><br />Step five: find the person who annoys Robin most in the world...</em><br /><br />Nobody asked for your help, Patrice!<br /><br /><em>...and ask for her help.</em><br /><br />Oh, hi, Barney.<br /><br />What are you doing here?<br /><br />Actually, I'm looking for you.<br /><br />This may sound kind of weird, but I have a proposition...<br /><br /><em>Explain everything to Patrice and hope she agrees to help.</em><br /><br />Yay. I love Robin.<br /><br />Of course I'll help.<br /><br />(giggles)<br /><br />Good, good.<br /><br />(screams)<br /><br /><em>Step six: check with your doctor about possible broken ribs.<br /><br />Step seven: pretend to be dating Patrice.</em><br /><br />Nobody asked you here, Patrice!<br /><br />Actually, I did.<br /><br /><em>Step eight: wait until Robin inevitably breaks into your place to find the Playbook and show it to Patrice, which you'll monitor via the hidden cameras you have in your apartment.</em><br /><br />Patrice, the robin's in the nest.<br /><br />That means Robin broke into my apartment Were you even listening when I explained the codes?<br /><br /><em>Step nine: after Patrice finds the Playbook, have your first big fight.</em><br /><br />This is going so well.<br /><br />Thank you so much.<br /><br />I know, but what the heck are Lily and Ted doing here?<br /><br />I don't know.
